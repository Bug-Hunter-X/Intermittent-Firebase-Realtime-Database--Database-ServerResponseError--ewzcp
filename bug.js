The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Database.ServerResponseError` with a message like "transport error" or "network request failed".  This often occurs intermittently and doesn't consistently point to a problem in the client code. The error isn't always accompanied by clear network connectivity issues, making debugging difficult.  This might involve using a simple set() method.  The error manifests despite seemingly correct authentication and database rules.  Example:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('/myData').set({ myValue: 'newValue' }).catch(error => {
  console.error('Database write failed:', error);
});
```
